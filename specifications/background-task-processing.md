# Background Task Processing

## Objective

Describe the management and execution of background and long-running tasks (e.g., file import/export, synchronization, notifications).

## Main Features

- Asynchronous processing of maintenance and long-running jobs
- Decoupling of API requests from heavy operations
- Progress and status tracking for background tasks
- Error handling and retry logic
- Logging and tracing of all background operations

## Architecture

- Background tasks are implemented as hosted/background services in the backend
- Communication between API and background services uses Channels (producer/consumer pattern)
- Tasks are queued and processed independently of API requests

## Business Rules

- Only authorized users can trigger or manage background tasks
- All background operations are auditable
- Task results and errors are accessible via the API

## Technical Notes

- All background jobs are monitored via OpenTelemetry
- Errors are reported using the platform's error handling conventions
- Configuration (e.g., concurrency, timeouts) is managed via environment variables

## Background Email Tasks

Background tasks include email sending for the following scenarios:
- When a new user is added: send an invitation email to the user
- Weekly summary email to product owners for each solution
- Weekly summary email to the administrator with all solutions
- Notification emails in case of errors in background processes
